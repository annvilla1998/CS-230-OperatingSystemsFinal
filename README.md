# CS-230 Operating Systems Final: The Gaming Room


<li>Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?</li>
</br>
<p>The Gaming Room wants to develop a web-based game that can run on multiple platforms. They game will be named "Draw It or Lose It" and is already present on androids. The software will need to efficiently render and pull many images from storage as part of the game.</p>
</br>
<li>What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?</li>
</br>
<p>I thoroughly described recommendations to the client for operating platforms, operating systems architectures, storage management, memory management, distributes ystems and networks, and security. </p>
</br>
<li>What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?</li>
</br>
<p>Working through a design document will be super beneficial when tackling code development for the software.</p>
</br>
<li>If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?</li>
</br>
<p>If I had to choose one part of this document to revise, I would choose the evaluation section. My professor's feedback noted that I was lacking information on the client side, which I noticed looking back.</p></p>
</br>
<li>How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?</li>
</br>
<p>I interpreted the user's needs by putting myself in their shoes. I always ask myself: What would I want from this user experience? In this particular case I asked myself: What would I want if I were playing this game? My answer was fast image rendering, accurate timing, and an overall fair game. This all means from a developer's perspective that the game requires scalability/flexibility, efficient storage and memory management. It is important to consider the user's  needs when designing because they are the purpose of the project. Without the user, there is no game. The user is the most important thing to consider for all software.</p>
</br>
<li>How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?</li>
</br>
<p>While designing this software, most of my time was contributed to research. The way to ensure the best software application is to use the best industry practices.</p>
